To test the application, you can use POSTMAN like the following:

	1. Copy paste http://localhost:8080/oauth/token as a POST request
	2. Go to authorization tab and use basic auth for inserting
	the username as kurosh-client-username and password as kurosh-secret-client-password
	3. Go to the Body tab and insert the username, password, and grant_type according
	to your database and own configuration
